Please test that your pull request works against a running instance of your third party service.

Even though you have written unit tests that use example payloads from your service, you may find that your service encodes it in a way that you didn't expect. Sometimes services will [url form encode a json payload](https://github.com/gitterHQ/services/blob/master/lib/travis/examples/fixed.form). Weird eh?

**We will not merge your pull request if you haven't verified it with your live third-party service**
